This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Basic commands on R -- part 2

Simple operations
```{r}
length <- 10
breadth <- 5
area <- length * breadth
length
breadth
area
```

Here above length was just one number. 
Now how do we deal with a list of numbers? What if we had several lengths? 
We will need numeric vector for this

```{r}
length <- c(2, 1, 5)
length

mynums <- 1:10
mynums
```

Now say you have several breadths as well and you need to calculate the areas
```{r}
length <- c(2, 1, 5)
breadth <- c(2, 2, 2)
area <- length*breadth
area
```


```{r}
length(area)
mode(area)
class(area)
```

operating on Numeric vector
```{r}
sumarea <- sum(area)
sumarea

minarea <- min(area)
minarea

maxarea <- max(area)
maxarea

rangearea <- range(area)
rangearea
```


standard deviation, mean and median 
```{r}
mean(area)
sd(area)
median(area)
```


Indexing Numeric vector
```{r}
area[2]
area[1]
area[-2] # retrieve everything except second position
```


character vectors
```{r}
gender <- c('F', 'M', 'M', 'F', 'F')
gender
class(gender)
```



Finding repetition of a character
```{r}
gender[gender == 'F']
```

DATAFRAMES: say you want to include numeric and character type data 
operating on Data frames
```{r}
participant <- c('louis', 'paula', 'vincenzo')
mydf <- data.frame(participant, score = c(67, 85, 32)) 
mydf
```

Operating on a dataframe
```{r}
colnames(mydf)
mydf$score
mean(mydf$score)
summary(mydf)
```

Indexing on Data frame
```{r}
mydf[1,] # first row

mydf[,2] # second column

mydf[, 2][2] # second column, second entry

```


OPENING AND INSPECTING DATASETS

Check datasets that R has in store for you
```{r}
data()
```

Let's load the "ChickWeight" Dataset: Weight versus age of chicks on different diets
```{r}
data(ChickWeight)
```

Let's take a look at the first few lines of the dataset
```{r}
head(ChickWeight,5)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
